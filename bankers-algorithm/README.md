# producer-consumer

A simple C program to demonstrate the solution to the popular "producer-consumer" critical section problem. I solved this using semaphores to synchronize the two programs with mutual exclusion.

## Explanation

Topic: Bankerâ€™s Algorithm for deadlock avoidance.

Considering a system with five processes P0 through P4 and three resources of type A, B, C. Resource type A has 10 instances, B has 5 instances and type C has 7 instances. Suppose at time t0 following snapshot of the system has been taken:

## Problem
Is the system in a safe state? If Yes, then what is the safe sequence?

## Disclaimer

As of right now, this program is only a demonstration of my knowledge on deadlock avoidance for a class homework assignment. In the future, I plan to revisit this project increasing the complexity and usability. Thank you!

## Installation/Download

This program must run in a UNIX/LINUX environment. You will get errors if attempting to run in Windows/MacOS.

You may choose to clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/tdrewek/CS33211.git
```
Or you may choose to download the zip file [here](https://github.com/tdrewek/CS33211/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).

## Usage

Open a terminal/console and navigate to the folder "CS33211" if cloned or "CS33211-main" if downloaded. Once in the CS33211 directory, navigate to the "producer-consumer" directory.

Once in the "producer-consumer" directory, you can run the program by executing three lines as shown below:

```
gcc producer.c -pthread -lrt -o producer
gcc consumer.c -pthread -lrt -o consumer
./producer & ./consumer &
```

## Example

Once the two programs begin running, it will continue until a total of 10 item sets have been completed. An item set is complete once 2 items have been added to the table, and then removed from the table (shown below with comments). After the 10 item sets are complete, it will stop producing items. You can terminate the program after the 10 item sets are complete by using the stop command: "CTRL + C".
